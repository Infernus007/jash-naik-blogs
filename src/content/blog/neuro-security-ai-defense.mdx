```python showLineNumbers {1-15} /neural/ caption="Neural Defense System" title="neural_defense.py"
class NeuralDefenseSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.threat_patterns = []
        self.adaptation_rate = 0.1
        self.memory_capacity = 1000
        
    def process_threat(self, input_signal):
        # Neural-inspired threat processing
        threat_level = self.analyze_pattern(input_signal)
        if threat_level > self.threshold:
            self.adapt_defense(threat_level)
            return self.generate_response(threat_level)
        return None
        
    def adapt_defense(self, threat_level):
        # Adaptive learning mechanism
        self.threshold = self.threshold * (1 + self.adaptation_rate * threat_level)
