## Introduction: Why AWS Strands Agents Matter

Imagine building an AI assistant that can research topics, perform calculations, make API calls, and coordinate with other AI agents—all without writing complex workflow logic. This is the promise of AWS Strands Agents, a revolutionary open-source SDK that emerged from AWS's internal production needs.

Released in May 2025, Strands Agents represents a fundamental shift from traditional agent frameworks. While most frameworks require developers to define rigid workflows and complex orchestration logic, Strands embraces the intelligence of modern language models to handle planning and execution autonomously. Multiple AWS teams, including Amazon Q Developer, AWS Glue, and VPC Reachability Analyzer, already rely on Strands for production workloads.

</figure>



The framework's name reflects its core philosophy: like the two strands of DNA, Strands connects the two essential components of any AI agent—the model and the tools. This elegant simplicity makes agent development accessible while maintaining the power needed for complex enterprise applications.

## Core Concepts Explained Simply

### Agents & Agent Loop

Think of a Strands agent as a thoughtful assistant who knows when to think, when to use tools, and when to respond. At its heart, an agent consists of three components: a model (the brain), tools (the hands), and a prompt (the instructions).

The agent loop operates like a continuous decision-making process. When you ask a question, the agent evaluates whether it can answer directly or needs additional information. If tools are required, the agent selects appropriate ones, processes the results, and continues reasoning until the task is complete.

<figure className="my-8">
  <Image 
    src={getImagePromise("/strands/workflow.png")} 
    alt="AWS Strands Agents workflow showing the model-driven agent loop" 
    width={800} 
    height={400}
    class="rounded-xl w-full hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform"
  />
  <figcaption className="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-2 text-center">

  </figcaption>
</figure>

This model-driven approach eliminates the need for hardcoded workflows that plague traditional frameworks. Instead of predicting every possible path, the agent uses the model's reasoning capabilities to navigate complex scenarios dynamically.

### Sessions, State, and Context Management

Strands agents maintain context across interactions through sophisticated session management. Each conversation preserves memory, allowing agents to reference previous exchanges and build upon earlier work.

The framework automatically handles context windows, token management, and conversation history without requiring manual intervention. Developers can customize how context is managed, where session state is stored, and how memory persists across agent restarts.

### Tools Integration: The Agent's Superpowers

Tools transform conversational agents into action-oriented assistants. Strands offers multiple integration approaches:

## Streaming Agent Responses in Real-Time

The Strands Agents SDK provides two primary methods for **streaming agent responses in real-time**: **Async Iterators** and **Callback Handlers**. Both mechanisms allow you to intercept and process events as they happen during an agent's execution, which is useful for real-time monitoring, custom output formatting, and integrating with external systems.

</figure>

### Async Iterators for Streaming

**Async Iterators** are specifically designed for real-time streaming of agent responses in **asynchronous environments** such as web servers, APIs, FastAPI, aiohttp, or Django Channels.

*   **How it works**: The Strands Agents SDK offers the `stream_async` method, which returns an **asynchronous iterator**. You can then iterate over this `agent_stream` to receive events as they occur.
*   **Basic Usage Example**:

<Placeholder>
```python showLineNumbers caption="Using async iterators for streaming" title="streaming_async.py"
import asyncio
from strands import Agent
from strands_tools import calculator

# Initialize agent without a callback handler
agent = Agent(tools=[calculator], callback_handler=None)

# Async function that iterates over streamed agent events
async def process_streaming_response():
    agent_stream = agent.stream_async("Calculate 2+2")
    async for event in agent_stream:
        print(event)

# Run the agent
asyncio.run(process_streaming_response())
```
</Placeholder>

*   **Event Types**: The async iterator yields various event types, allowing you to track different stages of the agent's operation:
    *   **Text Generation Events**: `data` (text chunk), `complete` (final chunk indicator), `delta` (raw delta content).
    *   **Tool Events**: `current_tool_use` (information about the tool being used, including `toolUseId`, `name`, and `input`).
    *   **Lifecycle Events**: `init_event_loop`, `start_event_loop`, `start` (new cycle), `message` (new message created), `event` (raw model stream event), `force_stop`, `force_stop_reason`.
    *   **Reasoning Events**: `reasoning`, `reasoningText`, `reasoning_signature`.

### Callback Handlers for Streaming

**Callback Handlers** are another powerful feature that enables you to intercept and process events during agent execution. They receive events in real-time as they occur, including text generation, tool selection and execution, reasoning processes, errors, and completions.

*   **How it works**: You pass a **callback function** to your agent's `callback_handler` parameter. This function will be invoked with keyword arguments corresponding to the event types as they stream.
*   **Basic Usage Example**:

<Placeholder>
```python showLineNumbers caption="Using callback handlers for streaming" title="streaming_callback.py"
from strands import Agent
from strands_tools import calculator

def custom_callback_handler(**kwargs):
    # Process stream data
    if "data" in kwargs:
        print(f"MODEL OUTPUT: {kwargs['data']}")
    elif "current_tool_use" in kwargs and kwargs["current_tool_use"].get("name"):
        print(f"\n USING TOOL: {kwargs['current_tool_use']['name']}")

# Create an agent with custom callback handler
agent = Agent(tools=[calculator], callback_handler=custom_callback_handler)
agent("Calculate 2+2")
```
</Placeholder>

*   **Event Types**: Callback handlers receive **the same event types as async iterators**.
*   **Default Callback Handler**: The SDK provides a `PrintingCallbackHandler` that formats output to the console, and you can set `callback_handler=None` to disable all output.
*   **Custom Callback Handler Examples**:
    *   **Print all events**: A `debugger_callback_handler` can print all keyword arguments received, showing full event details.
    *   **Buffering Output Per Message**: A `message_buffer_handler` can leverage the `message` event (triggered when a complete message is created) to buffer incrementally streamed text and display only complete, coherent messages, which is useful for chat interfaces.
    *   **Event Loop Lifecycle Tracking**: An `event_loop_tracker` can illustrate the flow of execution by tracking lifecycle events like `init_event_loop`, `start_event_loop`, `start`, `message`, `complete`, and `force_stop`.

**Note**: While both Async Iterators and Callback Handlers provide streaming capabilities, **Async Iterators are ideal for asynchronous frameworks** like FastAPI, while callback handlers can be used by passing a callback function.
