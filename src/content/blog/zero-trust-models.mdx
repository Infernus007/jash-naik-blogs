This theme comes with the [@astrojs/mdx](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) integration installed and configured in your `astro.config.mjs` config file. If you prefer not to use MDX, you can disable support by removing the integration from your config file.

## Why MDX?


To use images in your MDX files, you can use the standard Markdown syntax or HTML img tag:

![hero image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRmCy16nhIbV3pI1qLYHMJKwbH2458oiC9EmA&s)

Choose the method that best suits your needs. The Image component offers optimizations but requires an import.

MDX is a special flavor of Markdown that supports embedded JavaScript & JSX syntax. This unlocks the ability to [mix JavaScript and UI Components into your Markdown content](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#mdx-features) for things like interactive charts or alerts.

If you have existing content authored in MDX, this integration will hopefully make migrating to Astro a breeze.
