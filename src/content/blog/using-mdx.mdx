This theme comes with the [@astrojs/mdx](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) integration installed and configured in your `astro.config.mjs` config file. If you prefer not to use MDX, you can disable support by removing the integration from your config file.
	
## Why MDX?

MDX is a special flavor of Markdown that supports embedded JavaScript & JSX syntax. This unlocks the ability to [mix JavaScript and UI Components into your Markdown content](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#mdx-features) for things like interactive charts or alerts.

If you have existing content authored in MDX, this integration will hopefully make migrating to Astro a breeze.

console.log("Hello world!");

// highlight-start
const greeting = "Hello, ";
const name = "Developer";
console.log(greeting + name);
// highlight-end

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// This is a comment
const result = add(5, 3);
console.log(`The result is: ${result}`);
```
